## Feishu Document Skill Creation

Created `feishu-doc-best-practices` skill at `C:\Users\31509\clawd\skills\feishu-doc-best-practices\SKILL.md`

### Key Learnings from Today's Experience

**Problem**: Was incorrectly formatting Feishu documents by mixing titles and body content into single blocks, causing all content to appear in the document title.

**Solution**: Use `append` action with separate calls for headings vs body text.

### Correct Pattern

```
1. Initialize: update_block with just the main document title
2. Append H2: append with "## Section Title"
3. Append Body: append with "Body content..."
4. Repeat for each section
```

### Critical Distinctions

- `write` = replaces ALL content (deletes existing blocks)
- `append` = adds new blocks at end (preserves existing)
- `update_block` = modifies specific block content
- Markdown `##` auto-converts to Heading2 block_type:4
- Plain text auto-converts to Text block_type:2

### Document Successfully Formatted

【苏总裁事迹整理】- properly structured with:
- 1 Page block (main title)
- 7 Heading2 blocks (section headers)
- 26 Text blocks (body content)
- 1 Divider block
